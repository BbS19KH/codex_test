# codex_test

This repository has been restructured into a multi‑module project representing a simple three tier architecture.

## Modules
- **presentation** – entry point for the application (e.g. controllers)
- **business** – application logic layer
- **data** – persistence layer

Each module is an independent Spring Boot project initialized with the standard Spring Boot structure.
